# Mechanisms-Of-Action-Prediction

Mechanisms of Action (MoA) prediction refers to the process of identifying and understanding how a particular substance, such as a drug or chemical compound, exerts its effects on biological systems or targets within the body. This is a crucial step in drug discovery and development, as it helps researchers determine whether a compound has therapeutic potential and how it might be used to treat specific diseases or conditions. MoA prediction can also be applied in various other fields, such as toxicology and environmental science, to assess the effects of compounds on living organisms.

Here is an overview of the key aspects and methods involved in Mechanisms of Action prediction:

1. **Data Collection:** MoA prediction starts with the collection of relevant data. This data can include information about the chemical structure of the compound, its physical and chemical properties, and its biological activity. High-throughput screening and omics technologies (such as genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) generate vast amounts of data that can be used for MoA prediction.

2. **Feature Extraction:** Data preprocessing involves extracting relevant features or descriptors from the collected data. For chemical compounds, this may include molecular fingerprints, structural properties, and physicochemical characteristics. For biological data, it could involve gene expression profiles, protein-protein interaction networks, and pathway information.

3. **Machine Learning Models:** MoA prediction often relies on machine learning techniques to build predictive models. These models can be trained on labeled data, where the MoA of compounds is known, to learn patterns and relationships between features and MoA outcomes. Common machine learning algorithms used for MoA prediction include support vector machines (SVMs), random forests, neural networks, and deep learning approaches.

4. **Validation and Evaluation:** After training the models, they need to be validated and evaluated to assess their performance. Common metrics for evaluating MoA prediction models include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Cross-validation techniques are often used to ensure the models generalize well to new, unseen data.

5. **Biological Interpretability:** Understanding the MoA of a compound is not just about prediction accuracy; it also involves biological interpretability. Researchers may use bioinformatics tools and databases to link predicted MoAs to specific biological pathways, targets, or cellular processes. This helps elucidate how a compound affects the organism at a molecular level.

6. **Integration of Multi-Omics Data:** In many cases, MoA prediction requires integrating data from multiple omics levels, such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. This holistic approach provides a more comprehensive view of how a compound influences various biological processes.

7. **Application and Drug Discovery:** Predicted MoAs can guide drug discovery efforts by identifying potential therapeutic targets, suggesting drug combinations for synergistic effects, or repurposing existing drugs for new indications. Additionally, MoA prediction can assist in toxicology assessments and environmental risk assessments for chemicals and pollutants.

8. **Challenges:** MoA prediction is a complex and challenging task due to the diverse and interconnected nature of biological systems. Limited data availability, noise in experimental data, and the need for biological validation are common challenges in this field. Furthermore, understanding the nuances of polypharmacology (multiple targets) and off-target effects is crucial for accurate prediction.

9. **Conclusion:** Mechanisms of Action prediction is a multidisciplinary field that combines chemistry, biology, data science, and computational methods to understand how compounds interact with biological systems. It plays a pivotal role in drug discovery and has the potential to accelerate the development of new therapies and improve our understanding of the effects of chemicals on living organisms.

# Dataset Description
In this competition, you will be predicting multiple targets of the Mechanism of Action (MoA) response(s) of different samples (sig_id), given various inputs such as gene expression data and cell viability data.

# Two notes:
The training data has an additional (optional) set of MoA labels that are not included in the test data and not used for scoring.
The re-run dataset has approximately 4x the number of examples seen in the Public test.

# Files

1. `train_features.csv` - Features for the training set. Features g- signify gene expression data, and c- signify cell viability data. cp_type indicates samples treated with a compound (cp_vehicle) or with a control perturbation (ctrl_vehicle); control perturbations have no MoAs; cp_time and cp_dose indicate treatment duration (24, 48, 72 hours) and dose (high or low).
2. `train_drug.csv` - This file contains an anonymous drug_id for the training set only.
3. `train_targets_scored.csv` - The binary MoA targets that are scored.
4. `train_targets_nonscored.csv` - Additional (optional) binary MoA responses for the training data. These are not predicted nor scored.
5. `test_features.csv` - Features for the test data. You must predict the probability of each scored MoA for each row in the test data.
6. `sample_submission.csv` - A submission file in the correct format.
